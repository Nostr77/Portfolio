# Portfolio

Most of my work was created under NDA. Depending on internal data (on-site) or, more recently, launched online on the customer's side remotely. 
Therefore, I created a couple of repositories based on open data because I need to demonstrate my portfolio as a data analyst. 
My primary technical expertise in SQL, Python, and PowerBI is covered by those repositories. The code is present.

## [1. PowerBI & Python. Automatic Analytical Dashboard based on PowerBI and Python. From API to Dashboard, combining archive data with recent one](https://github.com/Nostr77/AGSI)

## [2. SQL & PowerBI. Automatic Analytical Dashboard based on Azure SQL Database & PowerBI. The ETL created in Power Query M mixes injected data with SQL permanent data. PowerBI visuals are built on SQL direct queries.](https://github.com/Nostr77/AGSI_SQL)

## [3. Python Plotly Dash.  Dashboard/Landing page. The primary balance sheet indicator for Ukrainian banks is covered.](https://github.com/Nostr77/bank) [ +++ Rendered Dash](https://ua-banks-balance.onrender.com/)
